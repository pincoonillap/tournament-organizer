This application is designed to handle the automatic creation and management of different types of gaming tournaments.  Specifically, it will provide the user with facilities for storing player information, setting up tournament brackets, and determining match-ups/groupings depending upon the type of game selected. The application consists of two parts: a core program that will provide the user with basic functionality, and plug-ins that will serve as templates for specific types of games or player combinations.  The primary goal of this application is to provide the user with an easy-to-use, visually appealing, all-in-one software package that will handle several different types of tournaments and greatly reduce the amount of time and effort involved in running a successful tournament.
