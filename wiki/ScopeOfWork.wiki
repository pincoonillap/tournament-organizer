This project will be compromised of two separate but related parts.  The first part will entail creating a core program with basic functionality that is responsible for loading applications from part two.  Part two is comprised entirely of plug-ins.  These plug-ins provide support in the form of specific game templates, countdown timers for certain types of games, and the creation of new brackets or groupings as well as the modification or progression of existing brackets or groupings.  

For the purposes of the scope of this project, no less than three game templates and a countdown timer, plus the base program, shall be completed.  Additional templates will be added if time permits.

This project is limited to the development of said tournament organizing software for use on computers utilizing Windows operating systems only.  Support for other operating systems may be added if time permits.
